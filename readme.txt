ArtPad is experimental software.

To use, install it, start WoW, and either type
/artpad show
or configure a key to show/hide/toggle in the key config menu.

Use left click to draw, right click to erase.
Everyone in the same party or raid automatically sees the same drawing.

The window can be moved with Shift-Click.
In raids, you only see what what leaders and yourself draw.

Planed:

- Store and Load drawings
